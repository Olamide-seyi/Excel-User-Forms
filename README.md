# Excel-User-Forms
Assessed and identified the obstacles faced by the Ondo State Bureau of Statistics during data collection from other MDAs.
It was discovered that the data collected are often full of missing information and wrong data types which makes the Bureau go through rigorous data cleaning process.
Therefore, I created user-friendly Excel forms to enforce accurate information input by other MDAs, thereby preventing errors or omissions.
Users of this user forms do not have to be proficient in the use of Excel.
